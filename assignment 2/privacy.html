        <h1>Privacy</h1>

        <p><strong>Privacy on Goodreads is designed to give users control over their personal information while
            participating in the community. When signing up, users create profiles that can be customized,
            including the option to add a profile picture, bio, and details about reading preferences.
            Users can choose what to make publicâ€”such as reviews, ratings, and book listsâ€”while keeping
            other aspects of their profiles, like their bookshelves or reading progress, private.
            You can also decide whether to share your activity feed or keep it restricted to only
            certain people, such as friends or followers.</strong></p>

        <p><strong>The platform offers several privacy settings to protect your data. For instance, users can set their
            profiles to either public or private, with different visibility options for different parts of the
            profile. Public profiles allow anyone on Goodreads to see your reviews, ratings, and bookshelves,
            while private profiles restrict access to your information. You can also choose to hide your reviews
            from search engines or make them visible only to friends. Additionally, Goodreads provides control
            over notifications, so users can limit who can send them messages or friend requests.</strong></p>

        <p><strong>However, despite these privacy options, there are aspects of the platform that remain publicly visible
            by default, such as your name and any books you've reviewed or rated, unless specifically adjusted in
            settings. Because Goodreads is a social platform where interaction is encouraged, users should be 
            mindful of the information they share in public spaces, such as forum discussions or comment sections.
            By regularly checking and adjusting privacy settings, you can enjoy a tailored and secure experience
            while still engaging with the diverse book-loving community.</strong></p>
